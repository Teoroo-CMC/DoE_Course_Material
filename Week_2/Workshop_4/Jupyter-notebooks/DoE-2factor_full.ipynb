Rather, we may measure the response with an instrument whose uncertainty has been quantified, or we may measure a quantity multiple times (or both). How do we determine the impact of that uncertainty on the model?\n",

Thus, for the three-factor full factorial experiment design, we are collecting data and running experiments in such a way that we obtain a model $\\hat{y}$ for our system response y, and  $\\hat{y}$ is a linear function of each factor:\n",

    "To obtain an estimate of the uncertainty, the experimentalist will typically make several measurements at the center point, that is, where all parameter levels are 0. The more samples are taken at this condition, the better characterized the distribution of uncertainty becomes. These center point samples can be used to construct a Gaussian probability distribution function, which yeilds a variance,  $\\sigma^2$ (or, to be proper, an estimate  s^2  of the real variance  $\\sigma^2$).

By trying the empirical model to the system, we can draw conclusions about the physical system - for example, if we were analyzing a chemically reacting process, and we found the response to be particularly sensitive to temperature, it would indicate that the chemical reaction is sensitive to temperature, and that the reaction should be studied more deeply (in isolation from the more complicated system) to better understand the impact of temperature on the response.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this notebook, we've covered a 2-level, three-factor factorial design from start to finish, including incorporation of uncertainty information. The design of the experiment was made simple by using the itertools and pandas libraries, and we showed how to transform variables to have low and high levels, as well as demonstrating a system response transformation. The results were analyzed to obtain a linear polynomial model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this process was a bit cumbersome. What we'll see in later notebooks is that we can use Python modules designed for statistical modeling to fit linear models to data using least squares and regression, and carry the analysis further."
